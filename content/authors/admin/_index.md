I am a PhD student in social psychology at Princeton University. My research interests include social norms/deviance, inequity, identity development, and field experiments. Specifically, I am interested in exploring the causes and consequences of gender and racial disparities in occupations and interests. I aim to conduct research that can be used to inform institutional and public policies to reduce these disparities.
