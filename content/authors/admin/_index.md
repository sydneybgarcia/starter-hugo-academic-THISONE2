I recieved my BA in Psychology from the University of California, Berkeley (go bears!). At Berkeley, I conducted an honors thesis (advised by Dr. Dacher Keltner) on the relationship between news media consumption, stress, and well-being among Mexican farmworkers. After recieving my BA, I spent two years as a research coordinator in Dr. Jamil Zaki's Stanford Social Neuroscience Laboratory.

Currently, I am a PhD student in social psychology at Princeton University. My primary advisor is Dr. Betsy Levy Paluck. I am interested in social norms/deviance, inequity, and field experiments. My goal is to conduct research that can inform institutional and public policies aimed at making spaces more equitable and inclusive for people from marginalized backgrounds.
