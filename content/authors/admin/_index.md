I am a PhD student in social psychology at Princeton University working primarily with Dr. Betsy Levy Paluck. My research interests include social norms/deviance, inequity, identity development, and field experiments. Specifically, I am interested in exploring the causes and consequences of gender and racial disparities in occupations and interests. I aim to conduct research that can be used to inform institutional and public policies to reduce these disparities.

Before graduate school, I received my BA in Psychology with Honors from UC Berkeley. I completed an honors thesis (advised by Dr. Dacher Keltner) on the relationship between news consumption, stress, and well-being among Mexican farmworkers. I also spent two years as a research coordinator in Dr. Jamil Zaki's Stanford Social Neuroscience Lab.
