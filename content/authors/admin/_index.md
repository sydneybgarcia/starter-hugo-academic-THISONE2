I am a PhD student in social psychology at Princeton University working primarily with Dr. Betsy Levy Paluck. My research interests include social norms/deviance, inequity, identity development, and field experiments. Specifically, I am interested in exploring the causes and consequences of gender and racial disparities in occupations and interests. I aim to conduct research that can be used to inform institutional and public policies to reduce these disparities.

Before becoming a graduate student I was a research coordinator in Dr. Jamil Zaki's Stanford Social Neurosciece Lab. I recieved my BA in Psychology with a minor in Gender and Women's Studies from UC Berkeley. I was a research assistant and completed my honors thesis in Dr. Dacher Keltner's lab.
