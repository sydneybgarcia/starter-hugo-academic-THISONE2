**Talk Series**

In the fall of 2020 I helped organize a Professional Development Talk Series for underrepresented minority students (URMs). We recorded the series, which includes talks on how to apply for post-bacc jobs, how to do well on the GRE, how to apply to graduate school, and more! Check it out [](https://www.ssnl.stanford.edu/resources)below.
