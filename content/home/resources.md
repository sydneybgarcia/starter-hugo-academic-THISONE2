**Talk Series**

In the fall of 2020 I helped organize the Stanford Social Neuroscience Professional Development Talk Series. We recorded the series, which includes talks on how to apply for post-bacc jobs, how to do well on the GRE, applying to grauate school, and more! Check it out [here](https://www.ssnl.stanford.edu/resources).

**Recommended Graduate Application Guides**

When I was applying for graudate programs I relied heavily on the following guides. I hope they can aid in your application process as well!

**Final Note**

I am very open to talking with underrepresented minority students who want advice on applying for graduate school. I know process can be very stressful, and I am here to help! Please don't hesitate to reach out via email.
