abstract: In the present article, we use daily diary methodology to investigate
  how coping influences well-being via the engagement of positive emotions in
  immigrant farmworkers and university students from diverse ethnic backgrounds.
  In Study 1, in a sample of Latinx immigrant farmworkers (N = 76), we found
  that the daily use of adaptive coping strategies predicted greater daily
  well-being, and that this relationship was accounted for by greater daily
  experiences of positive emotions. In Study 2, in a sample of college students
  from Latinx, Asian, and European American backgrounds (N = 336), we replicated
  the mediating effect of positive emotionality on the effect of adaptive coping
  on daily well-being and extended these findings to an examination of
  longitudinal well-being. This work provides evidence of one mechanism by which
  coping affects well-being and is one of the first studies of these dynamics in
  Latinx samples.
